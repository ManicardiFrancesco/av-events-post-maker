# Instagram Post Maker

A minimal, user-friendly HTML + JavaScript tool to compose a centered grid layout and export it as a PNG for Instagram.

## Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter the city, date, street, and hours.
3. Set a background image (URL or upload).
4. Click **Download PNG**.

## Customize
- Font: edit `--font-card` in `style.css` to set the font for all four fields.
- City color: edit `--city-color` in `style.css`.
- Card size: `--card-width` and `--card-height` in `style.css`.

## Notes
- If a background URL does not download in the PNG, use an uploaded image instead (some hosts block CORS).
